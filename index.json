Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree from the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems at Beihang University in 2024, supervised by Prof. Qinping Zhao and Prof. Feng Lu. I received my B.S. degree from the School of Information Engineering at Chang’an University in 2019.\nMy research interests broadly include Extended Reality (XR) and human-computer interaction. Specifically, I focus on natural multimodal XR techniques (e.g., eye gaze, hand gestures, speech), eye-tracking technologies (e.g., pupil/iris detection, eyeball modeling, and 3D gaze estimation), and AI-driven XR interaction (e.g., deep learning-based or LLM-based XR interaction). I have published 10 papers as the first or co-author at top venues in VR/AR and HCI, including IEEE VR, ISMAR, TVCG, and IEEE THMS. I was awarded the first CCF Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation Incentive Award by the CCF Technical Committee on HCI (one of two recipients nationwide). I was a Program Committee member for AAAI 2025 and have served as a regular reviewer for many top venues, including IEEE VR, ISMAR, TVCG, IJHCI, and AAAI.\n","date":1729468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1729468800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, working with Prof. Haibin Duan.
