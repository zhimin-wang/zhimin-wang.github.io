Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree from the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems at Beihang University in 2024, supervised by Prof. Qinping Zhao and Prof. Feng Lu. I received my B.S. degree from the School of Information Engineering at Chang’an University in 2019.\nMy research interests broadly encompass Extended Reality (XR) and human-computer interaction. Specifically, I focus on natural multimodal XR techniques (e.g., eye gaze, hand gestures, and speech), eye-tracking technologies (e.g., pupil/iris detection, eyeball modeling, and 3D gaze estimation), and AI-driven XR interaction (e.g., deep learning-based or LLM-based XR interaction). I have published over ten papers as first author or co-author in top venues for VR/AR and HCI, such as IEEE VR, ISMAR, IEEE TVCG, ACM CHI, and IEEE THMS. I was awarded the ACM CHI 2025 Best Paper Award and the inaugural CCF Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation Incentive Award by the CCF Technical Committee on HCI (one of only two recipients nationwide). I have served as a Program Committee member for AAAI 2025/2026 and as a regular reviewer for many top venues, including IEEE VR, ISMAR, TVCG, CVPR, IJHCI, and AAAI.\n","date":1753660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1753660800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, working with Prof. Haibin Duan.
